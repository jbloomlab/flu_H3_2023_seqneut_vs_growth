# Getting number of mutations from MRCA for the 2022 / 2023 library strains

The file [nextclade.auspice.json](nextclade.auspice.json) is a Nextstrain JSON of all of the strains at the time of library design plus the library strains provided by Caroline.

The notebook [get_mutations.ipynb](get_mutations.ipynb) processes that tree to get the mutations relative to the MRCA into the file [HA_mutations_from_MRCA.csv](HA_mutations_from_MRCA.csv).
