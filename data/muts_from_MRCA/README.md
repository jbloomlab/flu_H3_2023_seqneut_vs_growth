# Getting number of mutations from MRCA for the 2022 / 2023 library strains

The file [h3n2_ha.json](h3n2_ha.json) is the Nextstrain JSON of all of the strains at the time of library design.

The notebook [get_mutations.ipynb](get_mutations.ipynb) processes that tree to get the mutations relative to the MRCA into the file [HA_mutations_from_MRCA.csv](HA_mutations_from_MRCA.csv).
